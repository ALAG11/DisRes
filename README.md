## Introduction

**Natural disasters** such as floods, earthquakes, and wildfires pose significant threats to both wildlife and human civilization, often leading to the loss of lives and property. **This project is designed to address these challenges** by offering a **rapid response tool** for disaster situations.

Using **satellite imagery** and **advanced AI/ML models**, this system provides **emergency responders with real-time, actionable data**, allowing them to **assess the damage, classify disasters, detect affected buildings**, and **allocate resources effectively**.

## Features

- **Damage/no damage:** Detecting if any damage is caused du to natural disaster using **Binary classification** algorithm.
- **Disaster Classification:** Automatically classifies the type of disaster using satellite imagery and ML models.
- **Damage Assessment:** Evaluates regional damages, including the detection of affected buildings and infrastructure.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Provides up-to-date information to emergency responders to make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- DenseNet121 as the base model architecture
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Satellite Imagery
- Convolutional Neural Networks

## System Architecture

The system is built around a combination of satellite imagery analysis and AI/ML models. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. **Data Collection:** Satellite images and geospatial data are collected from various sources.
2. **Preprocessing:** The collected data is cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed for analysis.
3. **Modeling:** Various ML models are trained for tasks like disaster classification, damage assessment, and resource allocation.
4. **Prediction:** The trained models process new satellite imagery to provide real-time insights.
5. **Visualization:** Results are presented through an interactive dashboard, enabling emergency responders to view actionable insights.

## **Usage**

- **Interacting with the Models:**
   - **Upload satellite images** to analyze.
   - It detect if the area is effected or damaged by natural disaster or not.
   - The system will **classify the disaster, assess damage,** and **suggest resource allocations in real-time.**

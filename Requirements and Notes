Data Collection: Collect satellite images of areas before and after disasters. You’ll also need data on the locations of supplies and the routes taken by rescue teams in past disasters.
Disaster Detection: Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a disaster has occurred in a given area. You can use the before and after images for this. The model should be able to identify features like flooded areas, destroyed buildings, etc.
Supply Need Prediction: This is a more complex task as it involves predicting the needs of people based on the extent of the disaster. One approach could be to use a regression model that takes as input the output of your disaster detection model and predicts the number of supplies needed.
Route Optimization: For this, you can use algorithms like Dijkstra’s or A* for finding the shortest path. However, these algorithms need to know the state of all roads, which might not be possible immediately after a disaster. One way to handle this could be to integrate real-time data (like from Google Maps) into your model.
Integration: Finally, you need to integrate all these components into a single system. This could be a web application that takes as input a satellite image and outputs the locations of disasters, the predicted supply needs, and the optimal routes for supply delivery.
